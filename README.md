In this figure, Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night" image is decomposed into structure and texture. Starting from the left are the input, structure, and texture images. The graph on the far right represents the 1-dimensional signals of the scanline;s intensity values extracted from the input, structure, and texture images.

The most important parameter, which controls the degree of smoothing, is lambda. As lambda decreases, the more texture components are removed.
